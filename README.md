# AnimatedHoverCard
HTML / CSS / JS / JQuery animated card 

This is a project that I did for my studies by recovering elements from the Internet.
It allows you to animate an item when you hover over it using a JavaScript script and the JQuery library.
In this example, we animate a picture in a division.
